📊 Financial Data Visualization & Dashboard Reporting

📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between dense accounting data and executive decision-making. By converting a 3-statement financial model into visual components, this project highlights key trends, identifies anomalies (like the 2016 income spike), and illustrates the 5-year forecast trajectory. It turns "rows and columns" into a story of corporate growth and capital management.

🏗️ Project Structure

The visualization flow follows a structured data pipeline:The Data Engine: * Original Source & Workings: The raw transactional data and mapping layer that feeds the visuals.The Analytical Core:P&L & BS: The source of truth for all chart data, containing both historicals and the 5-year projected budget.The Visualization Layer:Trend Analysis: Charts tracking Revenue vs. Net Income growth over time.Capital Structure: Visual breakdown of the $615.8$ million debt profile and repayment schedule.Efficiency Metrics: Visualizations of Working Capital ratios (DSO, DIO, DPO) to monitor operational health.

🔍 Key Findings

The 2016 Pivot: Visualizing the historical period reveals a dramatic climb in Net Income from $36.7$ million in 2015 to $303.2$ million in 2016.Forecast Trajectory: The "Best Case" scenario visualization shows a steady upward trend, with profits projected to reach $402.1$ million by 2021.Margin Analysis: Line charts indicate stabilizing margins despite a heavy debt load, suggesting improved operational efficiency over the 5-year forecast.Debt Reduction: The Financial Liabilities schedule, when visualized, shows a clear deleveraging path despite the 9% interest rate.🛠️ Tools & Techniques UsedDynamic Charting: Utilizing Excel charts that automatically update when the Scenario Toggle (Cell C3) is switched.Scenario Comparison: Using overlapping charts to compare "Best Case" vs. "Base Case" outcomes.Conditional Formatting: Highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) in the P&L and BS tabs to signal variance.Slicers & Interactive Toggles: Allowing users to filter data by year or scenario to see immediate visual impacts on the balance sheet.Data Mapping: Ensuring that "Raw Data" accurately populates the visuals through structured Workings sheets.

🚀 How to Use

Interact with the Toggle: Go to the P&L tab. Change the scenario in cell C3. Observe how the associated charts and graphs reflect the change in real-time.Explore the Trends: Look for the graphical summaries of the Fixed Assets and Liabilities to see how depreciation and interest expenses impact the bottom line visually.Audit the Source: If a data point looks off, trace it back from the chart to the Workings tab to see the underlying bookkeeping entry.
